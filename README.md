# Full stack project 3a React Frontend

NOTE: This React app only with the backend server running since these two projects are in different repositories.
In this project I created a frontend to the api application made in the course as a 2nd project.

On the frontpage of the website, the user can search for a movie by title and the app will print out the first 5 movies in the database with the searched title string.
The first 5 movies that are printed in the table below the search field will display the title, the release year, the director(s), the poster and the id for the movie.
After searching for a movie and it being displayed in the table below, the user can then update or delete the document from the database.
By clicking "Update" the app will pop open an interface where the user can input the updated details of the movie.
The user can also delete the entire document from the database by clicking the "Delete" button.
The user can also add a new movie to the database by clicking the "Add Movie" button. This will pop open an interface where the user can input the details of the movie.
